On a more personal note I have to say that this was both the most challenging and fun project I got to work on.

I have three main python files:

1. app.py (The flask app used for the site)
2. scraper.py (The code responsible for the scraping functionality)
3. database.py (Managing the databases holding the search results)

I also have the actual database and a json file for the google authentication.

You can run the main app by using the 'flask run' command from the terminal, and accessing the server (http://localhost:5000/).

Bonus (google authentication) is implemented.

Hope you enjoy!
